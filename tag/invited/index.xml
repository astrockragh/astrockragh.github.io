      <description>&lt;!-- Galaxies’ properties are coupled to each other, as well as to their environments and merger histories. Unfortunately, these couplings are usually ignored in widely used statistical models of galaxies, often due to the difficulties of efficiently expressing them. I will introduce the tools necessary to explicitly introduce detailed descriptions of environments and merger histories into a statistical framework, and prove a surprising connection between the merger histories and environments of galaxies. I will then show how component coupling is implicitly treated in common codes which infer the physical parameters of galaxies, how the correct coupling strength can be empirically proven, and how this implicit treatment impacts the inferred parameters. --&gt;

      <title>Challenging modelling assumptions by connecting the optical and IR @Princeton</title>
      <link>https://astrockragh.github.io/talk/2024_thunch/</link>

      <description>&lt;!-- Galaxies are conventionally thought of as composites of physically distinct components, making the components separable. One consequence of this assumption is that different wavelength ranges carry little information about each other, since the different components dominate emission at different wavelengths. This common assumption of separability is implicitly embedded in galaxy spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting codes, which are broadly used to derive the physical parameters of galaxies. In this paper, we show that optical spectra can be used to predict near- and mid-infrared photometry to $\chi^2_N \approx 1$, in strong contrast with SED fitting codes. We also demonstrate that derived quantities such as the bolometric luminosity of active galactic nuclei (AGN) can empirically be tightly constrained from the optical, just as dust parameters such as $\mathrm{q_{PAH}}$. We investigate the shortcomings of the separability assumption in SED fitting codes, finding that it leads to biases and imprecision in parameter inference. We construct a tool for determining the most important areas of improvement for SED models.  --&gt;
