      <description>&lt;!-- Galaxies’ properties are coupled to each other, as well as to their environments and merger histories. Unfortunately, these couplings are usually ignored in widely used statistical models of galaxies, often due to the difficulties of efficiently expressing them. I will introduce the tools necessary to explicitly introduce detailed descriptions of environments and merger histories into a statistical framework, and prove a surprising connection between the merger histories and environments of galaxies. I will then show how component coupling is implicitly treated in common codes which infer the physical parameters of galaxies, how the correct coupling strength can be empirically proven, and how this implicit treatment impacts the inferred parameters. --&gt;

      <title>The sky over Mauna Kea observed with SuNSS</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As astronomy pushes towards ever fainter targets, at ever greater distances, in ever greater numbers, we are faced with a new series of problems which need solving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two main focus areas for the next generation for surveys are thus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Observing many targets at the same time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increasing the sensitivity to faint targets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first issue can be solved by multi-object observations. There are many ways of doing this, for example, if all we are interested is in pictures or photometry, we can take a single, ultra-high-resolution picture, and then analyze subdivisions later. This is the approach taken by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://rubinobservatory.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)&lt;/a&gt;. However, if we want detailed &lt;strong&gt;spectra&lt;/strong&gt; (light split up wavelength with high resolution), the most information-rich data type in astronomy, we must do things differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the &lt;a href=&#34;https://pfs.ipmu.jp/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS)&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaru_Telescope&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Subaru Telescope&lt;/a&gt;, we do &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-Object_Spectrometer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;multi-object spectroscopy&lt;/a&gt; using optical fibers. This means that we focus the light from the area we are observing onto 2400 separate points, connected to optical fibers to lead them to our spectrograph. Now we can treat this as 2400 separate spectra, &lt;strong&gt;but we get them all at the same time!&lt;/strong&gt; So if we want to take spectra of 2400 galaxies for half an hour each, a series of observations that would previously have taken 100 nights, we just get all of them in the same half hour! So now we can observe many millions of targets.
You can see the focal plane (where we focus the light), with our 2400 fibers, in the picture below. One of the cool things about this is that we need to be able to move the fibers a bit to get them to follow the targets we want to observe, and this is done by tiny robots, called cobras. A cool video of them moving can be found by &lt;a href=&#34;https://pfs.ipmu.jp/instrumentation.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;clicking this link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now we know that we can observe a lot of galaxies. How about 2)?
The first you want to do is to get a big telescope! With PFS, we are lucky to have access to the very large &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaru_Telescope&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Subaru Telescope&lt;/a&gt;, situated on Mauna Kea at an altitude of 4,139 m (13,579 ft) in Hawai&amp;rsquo;i, USA.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; When you read very large, it can be hard to understand just how large, so here&amp;rsquo;s a picture of me (~1.8 m/~6ft tall) standing at the bottom of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Me next to the Subaru Telescope&#34; srcset=&#34;

               src=&#34;https://astrockragh.github.io/project/sunss_airglow/me_next_subaru_hubcdb564934d70ed8307657bdb01d7208_2558525_fec3754301b82fc64d708efc75df462d.webp&#34;
               width=&#34;570&#34;
               height=&#34;760&#34;
               loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary mirror is 8.2 m (320 inches) in diameter, one of the biggest in the world! The area of the mirror is twice that of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Webb_Space_Telescope&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;JWST Space Telescope&lt;/a&gt;. Building very large telescopes is one of the great advantages of having them on the ground, compared to in space. However, when we are on the ground, we have to deal with one of the things which scare astronomers the most&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;👻 &lt;strong&gt;The atmosphere&lt;/strong&gt; 👻&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why is the atmosphere scary? There are three main reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The atmosphere makes it hard to focus on distant objects. This is because air &lt;em&gt;moves&lt;/em&gt;, which spreads out the light, so that something coming from a single point gets spread out over a large area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The atmosphere absorbs light, making our targets fainter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, the biggest problem for PFS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The atmosphere emits light itself, glowing with light we call &lt;em&gt;airglow&lt;/em&gt;. When we look at anything from the ground, we always observe both the airglow and the target.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The airglow is a problem because airglow is both &lt;strong&gt;bright&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;variable&lt;/strong&gt;. Below, you can see an example of a simulated&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; galaxy spectrum, split up into sky and galaxy counterparts. It is clear that the galaxy is dominated by the airglow. The galaxy shown here is actually quite bright, the main PFS targets will be 100 times fainter, so detecting any galaxy component is really hard! Searching for galaxies from the ground is like searching for a tiny firefly behind a giant stadium light!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Simulated sky and galaxy spectrum&#34; srcset=&#34;
               /project/sunss_airglow/sky_sub_spectrum_hu0d48af7b4d388132fdf909cff4f8cf97_434505_14fb70cc84829a335ac746ba5f479c82.webp 400w,
               /project/sunss_airglow/sky_sub_spectrum_hu0d48af7b4d388132fdf909cff4f8cf97_434505_aa2f5753341ad79ccc86948bc23d2982.webp 760w,
               /project/sunss_airglow/sky_sub_spectrum_hu0d48af7b4d388132fdf909cff4f8cf97_434505_1200x1200_fit_q100_h2_lanczos_3.webp 1200w&#34;
               src=&#34;https://astrockragh.github.io/project/sunss_airglow/sky_sub_spectrum_hu0d48af7b4d388132fdf909cff4f8cf97_434505_14fb70cc84829a335ac746ba5f479c82.webp&#34;
               width=&#34;760&#34;
               height=&#34;446&#34;
               loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One exciting aspect of the airglow is that it actually is the same thing as aurora. In the above plot, the strong lines at 557 nm and 630 nm are actually the green and red light we see during aurora (look at the top of the article!). They are always there, but when we are not being hit by a solar storm, you cannot quite see them with the naked eye. However, as you may already have noticed, most of the airglow comes out in the infrared (IR), so if our eyes could see in the IR (wavelengths above 700 nm), we would have aurora all the time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this would definitely be spectacular, it also poses a major problem for ground-based astronomy, as can be seen in the above figure. So in order to observe faint galaxies from the ground, we must get really good at a process known as &lt;em&gt;sky subtraction&lt;/em&gt;. As the name suggests, this is the process with which we subtract the airglow from our spectra. However, this requires &lt;strong&gt;knowing&lt;/strong&gt; how the airglow was at the same time that the observation was taken. This is usually done by taking some of our 2400 fibers and pointing them towards blank pieces of sky. If we let fiber A point at a galaxy, we will observe &lt;code&gt;(galaxy+airglow)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;, and if we let fiber B point at a blank piece of sky, we will observe &lt;code&gt;(airglow)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;.
Taking &lt;code&gt;(galaxy+airglow)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;-&lt;code&gt;(airglow)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; will then give is the clean galaxy spectrum, &lt;code&gt;galaxy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing this efficiently requires &lt;em&gt;understanding&lt;/em&gt; the airglow. Luckily, we are not the first ones to worry about this, but in order to understand the airglow well, we must do some observations of our own. For this, we have built a small auxiliary telescope for Subaru, the Subaru Night Sky Spectrograph (SuNSS). As the name indicates, this telescope is dedicated to observing the airglow only. Because the airglow is so bright, we do not need to utilise a giant telescope, and we instead use two small telescopes with diameters of approximately 35mm/1.5in. These small telescopes are then connected to the same spectrograph as PFS, so except for being much smaller, it is exactly the same system. To give a sense of scale, here are some pictures of SuNSS mounted on what we call the &amp;ldquo;spider&amp;rdquo; of Subaru.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This little telescope has been a close companion of mine since January 2022, thanks to Jim Gunn and Robert Lupton at Princeton who had the idea for the instrument. So let us now summarize some facts about the airglow in the wavelength range we care about (380nm - 1270 nm).&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;1-airglow-is-dominated-by-emission-from-oh-molecules-followed-by-emission-from-molecular-oxygen-then-atomic-oxygen-and-sodium&#34;&gt;1) Airglow is dominated by emission from OH molecules, followed by emission from molecular oxygen, then atomic oxygen and sodium.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we look at the airglow, we can see that most of the airglow comes out in the form of what we call &lt;em&gt;lines&lt;/em&gt;. This means that the light is only at a specific wavelength, and that why we get this line-like appearance. These narrow lines show up because they come from specific atoms or molecules, and within these, quantum mechanics tells us that only certain energy levels and transitions are possible. So when we go from one level to another, we always observe exactly the same wavelength of light being emitted. The really cool thing about these levels is that they are unique for each atom or molecule, and therefore they serve as &lt;em&gt;fingerprints&lt;/em&gt; for molecules and atoms, which lets us identify what exactly is emitting the lines we see. This fingerprint technique is how we pick out that OH, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, atomic oxygen, and atomic sodium are responsible for the emission. Not only do we get to pick out the species, but we see that they behave differently over time! If we look at two spectra of the airglow, taken a few days apart, we can see that the different emitters change very differently with time! In the bottom panel below you see all the OH emission clearly in orange, and everything else in blue.
The atomic oxygen is denoted as NaD (D for doublet) and atomic oxygen is written as OI, which is astronomy jargon for a normal oxygen atom with all of its electrons in place.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atoms have only a small number of levels, but molecules have a lot, and that is because molecular energy can store energy in a way that atoms can&amp;rsquo;t: they can &lt;em&gt;vibrate&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;rotate&lt;/em&gt;. These rotations/vibrations can only happen at certain frequencies, but it opens up a lot more energy levels. That is why the OH and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; produce &amp;ldquo;forests&amp;rdquo; of lines, whereas the atoms only produce a few. This also means that it is the molecules, and especially the OH, is responsible for &lt;strong&gt;cooling the atmosphere at night!&lt;/strong&gt; Since the atmosphere cools through radiation, and most of the radiation comes from OH, that means that the atmosphere is mainly cooling through OH emission!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means that understanding the airglow is not only very important for astronomy, but also for climatology and climate change. This leads us to the next point!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;2-we-can-measure-the-temperature-of-the-atmosphere-using-the-airglow&#34;&gt;2) We can measure the temperature of the atmosphere using the airglow.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many things that control the emission of a molecule, but one of the most important things is the local temperature. That is because the local temperature dictates which lines are strong and which lines are weak.  If the local temperature is high, there will be more molecules that rotate or vibrate at higher frequencies, so the lines associated with these energy levels will be stronger, and on the other hand, if it is cold, more molecules will rotate/vibrate at low frequencies, so the lines associated with these lower energy levels will be stronger
This also means that we can &lt;strong&gt;measure&lt;/strong&gt; this temperature from the relative intensities of the lines. The measurement is only valid for the region that the OH is in, which is between 75-95 km up in the atmosphere, but here, we measure the temperature to be around 190K (-83 C/-117 F). However, this changes throughout the night, usually starting at 200K (-73 C/-99 F), then dropping to around 180K (-93 C/-135 F) right after midnight, before slwoly climbing again. This once again leads us to our next point&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;3-the-airglow-is-very-variable-with-time&#34;&gt;3) The airglow is very variable with time.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As discussed above, the airglow changes over time. It changes on scales of minutes, hours, days, years, and decades. This is because the atoms and molecules which emit the airglow change their densities and temperatures overnight, as a function of the seasons, and as a function of the solar cycle.
Even over a single night, we observe that most of the components change their intensity by more than 100%, which is why we measure it all the time with SuNSS and PFS. The quick changes are due to changes in the densities and temperature of the atmosphere, which cause the atmospheric layers containing the glowing atoms and molecules to rise and sink overnight. Quick changes can also be due to waves passing through the atmosphere, which compress and heat the atmosphere! We all know this from seeing videos of aurora, where the intensities change quite dramatically over time. All of this is tracked with SuNSS every night, so at the end of its lifetime, we will have a decade of very high-quality data of the upper atmosphere!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;4-the-airglow-is-pretty-uniform-on-the-night-sky&#34;&gt;4) The airglow is pretty uniform on the night sky.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting aspect that we determined from observations with SuNSS, is that most of the time, the airglow is quite uniform on scales of less than 1.5km (around 1 mile), so although it changes quite rapidly in time, it does so in a spatially coherent way. We have determined that the intensities are uniform to around 1% on the scales probed by SuNSS and PFS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;5-we-can-also-use-the-airglow-to-improve-our-telescopes&#34;&gt;5) We can also use the airglow to improve our telescopes.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I have mainly focused on the airglow itself, along with the how we get rid of it, we can also &lt;strong&gt;use&lt;/strong&gt; the airglow for calibrating our telescopes better! This will be probably be the subject of another post here, since I&amp;rsquo;m working on a couple of papers on this, but since those are not yet out, I will give a quick description here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two things that we can use the airglow for calibrating, the first is our &lt;em&gt;wavelengths&lt;/em&gt;. Whenever we move our telescope, everything shifts a little, and that means that the same point on our instrument does not always correspond to the same wavelength of light. We must thus continously recalibrate the wavelengths. As I mentioned above, every molecule and atom has a set of wavelengths that it can emit at, a sort of quantum mechanical wavelength-fingerprint, but if we have already identified the molecules and atoms producing the lines, we can use that fingerprint to calibrate to! Most of the wavelength calibration is done with OH lines, so they serve a crucial purpose! The really nice thing about using the atmosphere to calibrate after, is that it literally is everywhere you look, so you get a calibration source for free. Airglow really is a blessing and a curse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also use the airglow to calibrate the amount of light going through the telescope at different wavelengths, however, this is quite tentative and novel! The idea is that the relative intensities of each line is set by quantum mechanics, so if we can do the quantum mechanics right, we can tune our telescope so that the observed intensity ratios match the theoretical ones. This would solve a lot of problems, so maybe airglow can save us once again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter what, I love the airglow, and I hope that we all get to appreciate it more. To finish off, here is a nice 360-degree picture from next to Subaru, where the beautiful red airglow is obvious in the horizon!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building on &lt;a href=&#34;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...923....8S/abstract&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;previous work&lt;/a&gt; where we investigated the impact of cosmic variance on the probability of finding a single, ultra-high redshift galaxy, we now turn to the question of the mass of the most massive object in a given observed field. This was motivated by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...946L..13F/abstract&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;surprising abundance of massive objects observed with JWST&lt;/a&gt;, which challenged all galaxy formation models and even had some people questioning our cosmological model. However, the first analyses of this potential tension was done without much regard for potential subleties, something we attempted to mitigate in this paper. A major issue with many studies is that they often overlook an important factor: &lt;strong&gt;cosmic variance&lt;/strong&gt;. This refers to the uneven clustering of galaxies across different parts of the sky (see the above figure), which causes the number of galaxies observed in a given area to vary more than you’d expect from simple Poisson statistics. In essence, certain regions may systematically have more or fewer galaxies just because of where you&amp;rsquo;re looking, and this systematic is a &lt;strong&gt;big&lt;/strong&gt; effect in the very early universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cosmic variance becomes even more pronounced when you look at galaxies that are very massive, at high redshifts, or when observing small areas of the sky — just like in the deep surveys conducted by JWST. These narrow and deep surveys targeting the earliest, most massive galaxies, are especially vulnerable to the effects of cosmic variance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we developed a model to predict the distribution of mass of the most massive galaxies in given JWST surveys, taking the cosmic variance into account. The model shows that previous methods, which relied on &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10479&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;idealized Extreme Value Statistics&lt;/a&gt;, don’t fully capture the actual distribution. Instead, the new predictions reveal some surprising differences, both in the position and shape of the distribution of the largest galaxies, as can be see. The results were a little counterintuitive at first, but upon further reflection, they offer a more accurate picture of what we should expect to (and do) find in these surveys! This is shown in the below figure, where the yellow contours (including cosmic variance) can clearly be seen to greatly diverge from the green contours (no cosmic variance), at high redshift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test the models validity, we used simulations from &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07893&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;UniverseMachine&lt;/a&gt; (see the red contours in the figure above), an empirically calibrated tool designed to simulate galaxy formation in the universe. Sure enough, the predicted effects of cosmic variance stood out clearly, showing that it has a major impact on the most massive galaxies we may observe, in exactly the way our simple model predicted!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another key finding was that cosmic variance estimators are affected by a &amp;ldquo;variance on the variance&amp;rdquo; in a way that has so far been neglected. The uncertainty in the cosmic variance itself is highly non-Gaussian in the limit where the cosmic variance itself is high, and we both prove it and empirically measure the effect. The proof can be checked out in the paper, but the result is shown in the below figure!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the study underscores the importance of properly considering cosmic variance when interpreting the results of galaxy surveys, especially when trying to reconcile the existence of extreme galaxies in the early universe with existing galaxy formation models. Without doing so, we may be misinterpreting the true nature of the early universe. The effects for a few sample cases can be seen below.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;!-- Galaxies are conventionally thought of as composites of physically distinct components, making the components separable. One consequence of this assumption is that different wavelength ranges carry little information about each other, since the different components dominate emission at different wavelengths. This common assumption of separability is implicitly embedded in galaxy spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting codes, which are broadly used to derive the physical parameters of galaxies. In this paper, we show that optical spectra can be used to predict near- and mid-infrared photometry to $\chi^2_N \approx 1$, in strong contrast with SED fitting codes. We also demonstrate that derived quantities such as the bolometric luminosity of active galactic nuclei (AGN) can empirically be tightly constrained from the optical, just as dust parameters such as $\mathrm{q_{PAH}}$. We investigate the shortcomings of the separability assumption in SED fitting codes, finding that it leads to biases and imprecision in parameter inference. We construct a tool for determining the most important areas of improvement for SED models.  --&gt;

      <title>The galaxy-environment connection revealed by Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <guid>https://astrockragh.github.io/project/gnn_environment/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;To preface all of this, this work, consisting of two projects, was led by the incomparable &lt;a href=&#34;https://jwuphysics.github.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;John F. Wu&lt;/a&gt; at STScI/JHU, and it was a joy to work with him on this! Now on to the research.
The projects were started during the great &lt;a href=&#34;https://datadrivengalaxyevolution.github.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;KITP program on Data-Driven Astronomy&lt;/a&gt;, taking my earlier work on the connection between &lt;a href=&#34;https://astrockragh.github.io/project/mangrove/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;galaxies and their formation histories&lt;/a&gt;. A natural follow-up question is whether we can find similar improvements in our modelling of galaxies by exploiting their &lt;strong&gt;environments&lt;/strong&gt; instead of their &lt;strong&gt;formation histories&lt;/strong&gt;. We therefore dive into the intricate relationship between galaxies, dark matter halos, and their large-scale cosmic environments using data from the Illustris TNG300 hydrodynamic simulation. To better understand these connections, we tested two machine learning (ML) models: Explainable Boosting Machines (EBMs) and E(3)-invariant graph neural networks (GNNs). We use GNNs to make sure that we capture the full information in the cosmic web, instead of realying on summary statistics, an approach which we know did not work for analyzing formation histories! The E(3)-invariance, means that the functions we learned are made explicitly invariant to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_group&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;uclidean transfomations&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;D, meaning all translations, rotations, and reflections in 3D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main issues with analyzing environments is that the connections between different galaxies are not given &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt;. We therefore must pick a subjective length scale, within which we consider galaxies &amp;ldquo;connected&amp;rdquo;. We must then tune this &lt;strong&gt;linking length&lt;/strong&gt; (L), to give us the best results, and see what we can learn from this tuning. In the below plot, I show how graph structures that result from changing linking lengths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;

               src=&#34;https://astrockragh.github.io/project/gnn_environment/changing_linking_length_huadf1f8ecb3a9b479f02af79a8867c8ec_925841_825f36b36411bb9e43c98cabfaa114ae.webp&#34;

               loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now test our GNNs and our EBMs with a summary statistic that summarizes information on the same length scale as that used by the GNN. The summary statistic we choose is the &lt;em&gt;spherically averaged overdensity&lt;/em&gt;, in simple terms, the total amount of mass within a ball of radius L, centered on each galaxy. In summary we have two model, trained to predict the &lt;strong&gt;stellar masses&lt;/strong&gt; starting from &lt;strong&gt;dark matter&lt;/strong&gt;, the GNN using the dark matter halo, and those around it, and the EBM using the halo and the total amount of mass around it. Differences between the two are therefore only due to treatments in environment. The plot below shows our results as a function of linking length. The y-axis shows the reconstruction &lt;strong&gt;error&lt;/strong&gt;, so lower is better!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;

               /project/gnn_environment/error_length_hu174f52277a947edd04d4895efa36d3fe_228913_1200x1200_fit_q100_h2_lanczos_3.webp 1200w&#34;
               src=&#34;https://astrockragh.github.io/project/gnn_environment/error_length_hu174f52277a947edd04d4895efa36d3fe_228913_69763fcf07fe47e617296baec565fdb6.webp&#34;

               loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we see that the GNN (purple) is way better than anything else, including the EBM (blue)! So once again, summary statistics are not the way to go, and GNNs are really powerful! However, there is also interesting structure in the plot. The GNN keeps getting better with each increase of the linking length &lt;strong&gt;at the same rate&lt;/strong&gt; until at 3 Mpc, and then it levels off, but to another fixed rate! There seems to be something special about this length scale, since the behaviour of our model is essentially in one mode below 3 Mpc, and another above!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we look at the performance of the EBM, we also see a conspicuous curve with its best performance at a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the same length scale!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The 3 Mpc scale is clearly special!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;There is a special environment length scale&#34; srcset=&#34;

               src=&#34;https://astrockragh.github.io/project/gnn_environment/error_length_annotate_huffa39afaf9a987e8a2e1ccb1a0c579ba_398601_339c6607a1150b450dd8d63694b4bdaa.webp&#34;

               loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it&amp;rsquo;s also worth noting that the GNNs were able to pick up on environmental influences from larger scales—up to 10 Mpc—showing that there’s more to the galaxy–halo connection than just nearby density.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that we found quite amusing while doing this project was that many people who work with the cosmic web (large-scale positioning of galaxies) were very adamant that we would fail if we did not use this special algorithm called DisPerSE, which is supposed to provide an advanced topological description of the cosmic web, instead of just connecting things within a given length. However, we found that these simple spherical density measures were more useful than more complex cosmic web distance features derived from the DisPerSE algorithm (green line in the above plot).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The highest redshift galaxy we will find with JWST</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the primary goals for the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope is to observe the first galaxies. Predictions for planned and proposed surveys have typically focused on average galaxy counts, assuming a random distribution of galaxies across the observed field. The first and most-massive galaxies, however, are expected to be tightly clustered, which can be quantified through an effect known as &lt;strong&gt;cosmic variance&lt;/strong&gt;. We show that cosmic variance is likely to be the dominant contribution to uncertainty for high-redshift mass and luminosity functions, and that median high-redshift and high-mass galaxy counts for planned observations lie significantly below average counts. Several different strategies are considered for improving our understanding of the first galaxies, including adding depth, area, and independent pointings. Adding independent pointings is shown to be the most efficient both for discovering the single highest-redshift galaxy and also for constraining mass and luminosity functions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, I&amp;rsquo;ve written two versions of this post, this one is a little easier to understand (less jargon) and more fun! The other version can be found under &amp;ldquo;Research&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;motivation&#34;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When scientists discover something, there are three main things that we tend to ask ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the building blocks of that thing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is keeping the building blocks together in that particular structure?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How did the thing get assembled?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can think of it sort of like getting a new thing from IKEA. We discover a new object, say a galaxy, and it feels like we have discovered a new item in the IKEA catalogue that is our world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Boxes from IKEA&#34; srcset=&#34;

               src=&#34;https://astrockragh.github.io/post/mangrove/ikea_boxes_hua16e68f23b3733410713f9c2fa435ae2_928645_128d4430dd2e499ed4064fbe0abb1cb5.webp&#34;

               loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now we want to investigate it a bit more. We want to answer our three questions, and for that we just need to open the box and find the assembly manual, within which we find:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What parts is included for building our galaxy, i.e. the building blocks. For galaxies this would be some stars, some dark matter, some gas and so on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What tools are included to build our galaxy. For our galaxy we mainly just need one screwdriver, gravity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The instructions for how to use our tools to put together our parts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question 1 is actually not as simple as it looks. When we go out and look at galaxies, we see that there seems to a building block that affects the galaxy a lot, but that we cannot see. This is what we call &lt;strong&gt;dark matter&lt;/strong&gt;. While dark matter is weird, it is also quite simple. As far as we can tell, it only interacts with other things through gravity, but it is still fundamental to how galaxies end up being. This is because it collapses under its own gravity and makes gravitational wells where galaxies can form. These collapsed clumps are called halos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question 3 is by far the most complicated when it comes to galaxies, because it is really hard to observe. Galaxies evolve over v e r y long timescales.
Luckily, we have simulations we can investigate this with. There are a couple of key problems with the simulations though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are computationally expensive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are hard interpret/understand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making a model that emulates a simulation can solve problem 1 and give a lot of new insights into problem 2. So that is what we have done by building &lt;em&gt;Mangrove&lt;/em&gt;. Mangrove is a Machine Learning based emulator that takes into account all three core aspects of galaxy formations, building blocks, tools and assembly manual, to give us better galaxies faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;technical-stuff&#34;&gt;Technical stuff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, we don&amp;rsquo;t completely bypass the simulation step, since we still need to run a simulation, but only one with &lt;em&gt;nothing but dark matter&lt;/em&gt;. Because dark matter is so simple, this can be done pretty quickly. Then, once we have that simulation, we can try to &amp;ldquo;paint&amp;rdquo; galaxies on top of the dark matter. This is by no means the first time this has been attempted, but earlier papers have only included features from the final time step of the simulation as their input to their model. This essentially means that these methods can learn answers to questions 1 and 2 (current building blocks/tools), but are agnostic about the assembly of the galaxies. Mangrove improves on this by using not just the final time step, but an encoding of the temporal evolution of the dark matter known as a &lt;strong&gt;merger tree&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The merger tree is made by simply stopping the simulation at different time steps and identifying the halos where we know that galaxies live. We then see which halos merge with other halos from timestep to timestep, and build a tree-like structure encoding this evolution (see Fig. 1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- ![]() --&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;graphic1.png&#34; alt=&#34;First graphic&#34; style=&#34;width:100%&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption align = &#34;center&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fig.1 - Running a simulation and identifying halos at different time steps allows us to build the merger tree, which can then easily be encoded as a graph. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can then encode the merger tree as a mathematical &lt;strong&gt;graph&lt;/strong&gt;, which in this context simply means a collection of nodes and edges, where each node represents a halo, and the edges determine how they have interacted with each other over time. When we have the graphs we can use a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_neural_network&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Graph Neural Network (GNN)&lt;/a&gt;, to learn how the galaxies pertaining to those merger trees should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to build an emulator, we also have to find something to emulate. In this post I discuss results from emulating the outputs from a Semi-Analytic Model&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but it works just as well for other kinds of simulations, like magneto-hydrodynamical simulations like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tng-project.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;IllustrisTNG&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mangrove is a Graph Neural Network (GNN). GNNs work by acting on both nodes, and the &lt;strong&gt;neighbourhood&lt;/strong&gt; of that node, meaning all the nodes that is connected to it by an edge.
The way we learn from both nodes and neighbourhoods is through &lt;em&gt;Message Passing&lt;/em&gt;. Message passing means that each node sends information about its current state along the edges of the graph, and is then updated by a learnable&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; function &lt;em&gt;f&lt;/em&gt;. This information passed along the edges is then used to update the state of the node through another learnable&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; function &lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;graphic2.png&#34; alt=&#34;Second graphic&#34; style=&#34;width:100%&#34;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After doing a couple of these message passing steps, we then sum over all halos in the merger tree and use &lt;strong&gt;yet another learnable function&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;h&lt;/em&gt;, that decodes this sum and predicts the aspects of galaxies that we are interested in, such as the total mass of the stars in the galaxy, the mass of the black hole at the center and the amount of cold gas, as well as the uncertainties on these quantities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We like having uncertainties on our predictions, since we recognize that there might be a little area around the true value that would also be reasonable to predict. Furthermore, it gives the model the possiblity of simply letting us know if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t know what&amp;rsquo;s going on, instead of making a foolhardy guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;results&#34;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much better does Mangrove do compared to methods you ask?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, let&amp;rsquo;s compare how well assign stellar masses to halos work with different methods!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first comparison is with the traditional method for assigning galaxy properties based on their dark matter halos, Abundance Matching. Abundance Matching is quite simple, assuming only that there exists a monotonic relationship between halo and galaxy properties. That means that if we were to assign stellar masses to the halos, the most massive halo would get the highest stellar mass, the least massive the least stellar mass and so on. If we compare the abundance matched relationship to the one we predict, we see a dramatic difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;precision_abundance_match.png&#34; alt=&#34;precision graphic one&#34; style=&#34;width:100%&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption align = &#34;center&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fig.3 - We show the relationship between what we are supposed to be getting on the x-axis and what we actually predict using either method on the y-axis. A perfect prediction would mean that all point were on the diagonal, therefore the goal is to cluster as tightly around the diagonal as possible. The difference is quite apparent. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, that is perhaps an unfair comparison. We use machine learning after all, and abundance matching uses nothing but a single number per halo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should then maybe compare to other machine learning methods that use a lot of information &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; only from the final halo. That seems more fair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as is apparent, Mangrove still outperforms this by about a factor of 2 when measured by how much the two methods deviate from perfect predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;precision_halo.png&#34; alt=&#34;precision graphic two&#34; style=&#34;width:100%&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption align = &#34;center&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fig.4 - Same as Fig. 3, but comparing to the state of the art machine learning techniques. The difference is still striking. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mangrove can also predict a lot of other things, like the amount of cold gas in a galaxy (M&lt;sub&gt;cold&lt;/sub&gt;), how fast it is making stars right now (Star Formation Rate/SFR), how much metal there is in the gas (Z&lt;sub&gt;gas&lt;/sub&gt;) and the mass of the black hole at its center (M&lt;sub&gt;BH&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mangrove does better than all of the above mentioned methods across the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;precision_others.png&#34; alt=&#34;precision graphic three&#34; style=&#34;width:100%&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption align = &#34;center&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fig.5 - Same as Fig. 4/5, but here we show how other galaxy properties, all improvements over the current state of the art. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;other-fun-things&#34;&gt;Other fun things&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have a well-working model, we can then try to figure out where the improvement comes from. Is it in the first few timesteps, the initial conditions? Can we make galaxies at different spots in time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer to the last question turns out to be yes. If we take a single Mangrove model and train it at several different times (we encode this as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;redshift&lt;/a&gt;, usually written as a &lt;strong&gt;z&lt;/strong&gt;), we see that it both does well at the new times, but also in between!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;interpolation.png&#34; alt=&#34;interpolation&#34; style=&#34;width:100%&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption align = &#34;center&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fig.6 - Mangrove can do galaxies across time, and interpolate to timesteps it has never seen before! &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of removing things from the model, we tried to simply cut down the merger tree from above, leaving out the very earliest halos. We found that the closer you get to the present day, the more each halo matters. The effect is so strong that removing the first half of the merger tree doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter much, but removing the final 1% is measurable!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;trimming.png&#34; alt=&#34;interpolation&#34; style=&#34;width:100%&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption align = &#34;center&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fig.7 - By removing parts of the merger tree, we see that most of the information comes from times closer to the present day. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is one thing that one should remember from this paper, it is that the long-standing &amp;rsquo;nature versus nurture&amp;rsquo; debate is not just for humans. It also matters for galaxies, and with our code, Mangrove, we can take both aspects into account, and make big improvements!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It matters &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; we build our galaxies!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semi Analytic Models are a kind of simulation that is run after running a simulation of only the dark matter in the universe. A good early reference is &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9802268.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9802268.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any time I mention a &amp;ldquo;learnable function&amp;rdquo;, think about it as a very basic neural network, what we call a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). An illustration of an MLP can be found at &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network#/media/File:Neural_network_example.svg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network#/media/File:Neural_network_example.svg&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, I&amp;rsquo;ve written two versions of this post, this one is a little harder to understand (more jargon) but more concise! The other version can be found under &amp;ldquo;Blog posts&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efficiently mapping baryonic properties onto dark matter is a major challenge in astrophysics.
Although semi-analytic models (SAMs)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and hydrodynamical simulations have made impressive advances in reproducing galaxy observables across cosmologically significant volumes, these methods still require significant computation times, representing a barrier to many applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some advances have been made thanks to Machine Learning models, which learn mappings between the much less expensive dark matter only simulations and baryonic galaxy properties. However, these ML emulators still lack a lot of precision, and provide only few insights into the processes that they emulate! This is mainly because they try to map directly between dark matter halos and galaxies, ignoring formation and environmental effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this project, we improved on both the precision and interpretability of previous work in the field, by including the formation history and showing that when it comes to nature versus nurture for galaxies, &lt;strong&gt;nurture matters a lot&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do so by introducing &lt;strong&gt;Mangrove&lt;/strong&gt;, a Graph Neural Network which works on &lt;strong&gt;merger trees&lt;/strong&gt;, which encode the formation history of the dark matter halo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mangrove is twice as precise as other ML models, and allows us to put galaxies into dark matter simulations between 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; times faster than a SAM and IllustrisTNG codes, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;technical-stuff&#34;&gt;Technical stuff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, we don&amp;rsquo;t completely bypass the simulation step, since we still need to run a simulation, but only one with &lt;em&gt;nothing but dark matter&lt;/em&gt;. Because dark matter is so simple, this can be done pretty quickly. Then, once we have that simulation, we can try to &amp;ldquo;paint&amp;rdquo; galaxies on top of the dark matter. This is by no means the first time this has been attempted, but earlier papers have only included features from the final time halo of the simulation as input to their models (a list of relevant references can be found in our paper).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mangrove improves on these works by using not just the final halo, but an encoding of the temporal evolution of the dark matter in the shape of a &lt;strong&gt;merger tree&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The merger tree is made by simply stopping the simulation at different times/redshifts and identifying the halos where we know that galaxies live. We then see which halos merge with other halos from timestep to timestep, and build a tree-like structure encoding this evolution (see Fig. 1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- ![]() --&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;graphic1.png&#34; alt=&#34;First graphic&#34; style=&#34;width:100%&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption align = &#34;center&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fig.1 - Running a simulation and identifying halos at different time steps allows us to build the merger tree, which can then easily be encoded as a graph. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can then encode the merger tree as a mathematical &lt;strong&gt;graph&lt;/strong&gt;, which in this context simply means a collection of nodes and edges, where each node represents a halo, and the edges determine how they have interacted with each other over time. When we have the graphs we can use a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_neural_network&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Graph Neural Network (GNN)&lt;/a&gt;, to learn how the galaxies pertaining to those merger trees should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to build an emulator, we also have to find something to emulate. In this post I discuss results from emulating the outputs from a Semi-Analytic Model&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but it works just as well for other kinds of simulations, like magneto-hydrodynamical simulations like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tng-project.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;IllustrisTNG&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mangrove is a Graph Neural Network (GNN). GNNs work by acting on both nodes, and the &lt;strong&gt;neighbourhood&lt;/strong&gt; of that node, meaning all the nodes that is connected to it by an edge.
The way we learn from both nodes and neighbourhoods is through &lt;em&gt;Message Passing&lt;/em&gt;. Message passing means that each node sends information about its current state along the edges of the graph, and is then updated by a learnable&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; function &lt;em&gt;f&lt;/em&gt;. This information passed along the edges is then used to update the state of the node through another learnable&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; function &lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;graphic3.png&#34; alt=&#34;Second graphic&#34; style=&#34;width:100%&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption align = &#34;center&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fig.2 - Messages are passed along edges, and the nodes are updated. The updated nodes are then summed over and decoded to give us the properties of the galaxy that resulted from that merger tree. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After doing a couple of these message passing steps, we then sum over all halos in the merger tree and use &lt;strong&gt;yet another learnable function&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;h&lt;/em&gt;, that decodes this sum and predicts the aspects of galaxies that we are interested in, such as the total mass of the stars in the galaxy, the mass of the black hole at the center and the amount of cold gas, as well as the uncertainties on these quantities.&lt;/p&gt;

If we compare the abundance matched relationship to the one we predict, we see a dramatic difference. Note that all values are given in logarithmic units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption align = &#34;center&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fig.3 - We show the relationship between what we are supposed to be getting on the x-axis and what we actually predict using either method on the y-axis.

&lt;p&gt;Mangrove does better than all of the above mentioned methods across the board, which again, is a simple statement that &lt;strong&gt;formation history matters&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer to the last question turns out to be yes. If we take a single Mangrove model and train it at several redshifts, we see that it both does well at the new times, but also when interpolating! It is also noteworthy that the model does not become worse when doing the more complicated task of learning a more general mapping that applies at a wider range of redshifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;interpolation.png&#34; alt=&#34;interpolation&#34; style=&#34;width:100%&#34;&gt;

      <title>Classifying  $V^0$ - particles from the ATLAS detector for detector calibration</title>
      <link>https://astrockragh.github.io/project/puk_troels/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 25 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://astrockragh.github.io/project/puk_troels/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project was done in collaboration with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Vinther901&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Jonas Vinther&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/JohannSeverin&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Johann Bock Severin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/JakobSchauser&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Jakob H. Schauser&lt;/a&gt; during our third semester as physics undergraduates. Check out their GitHubs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all branches of physics, new discoveries are made by identifying some signal peak upon a background of noise. In High Energy Physics, this could be the peak of a new particle found amongst the almost uncountable amount of collisions happening every second the Large Hadron Collider is running. Only a few collisions actually produce interesting particles. This makes it crucial to be able to classify which detections are part of the actual signal, and which are not. In this project we employed a range of statistical methods and machine learning algorithms to get the best estimate of the masses of different $V^0$ - particles, in both simulated data and real data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

The background is fitted with a third degree polynomial and a double Gaussian is used on the peak.&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As can be seen in the top figure, among some of the methods tried were simply doing some linear cuts in the feature space, found by simple annealing, using Fisher&amp;rsquo;s discriminant analysis, a simple decision tree and some boosted decision tree algorithms, of which XGBoost ended up being the method of choice. We ended up getting an accuracy of 99.7% for classyfing signal and background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most exciting thing from this project was the ability for our models to learn what a true label looked like in real data without having those labels. Overall, the LHC dataset is fantastic as a learning platform for both classification and regression problem.

      <title>Classifying Gamma-Ray Bursts into Two Classes using t-SNE</title>
      <link>https://astrockragh.github.io/project/tsne_grb/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://astrockragh.github.io/project/tsne_grb/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The duration of a gamma-ray burst (GRB) is a key indicator of its physical origin, with long bursts perhaps associated with the collapse of massive stars (also known as supernovae) and short bursts with mergers of neutron stars (kilonovae).
However, trying to categorize these events from the burst itself is very troublesome, as there is substantial overlap in the properties of both short and long GRBs and neither duration nor any other parameter so far considered completely separates the two groups [insert figure]. Some very long bursts even show up without any observble supernova, even when we know exactly where it came from, which even led people to propose extra classes of bursts, like the Extended Short Gamma Ray Burst, to explain the lack of a supernova. In this project, which was done by myself and my two good friends &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/JohannSeverin&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Johann Bock Severin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Vinther901&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Jonas Vinther&lt;/a&gt; as a semester project during our first year at the University of Copenhagen, we unambiguously classified every known GRB from the Swift Space observatory, using a dimensionality reduction algorithm, t-distributed stochastic neighborhood embedding, which had never been before and so was quite exciting. Although the classification takes place only using prompt emission light curves, every burst with an associated supernova is found in the longer group and bursts with kilonovae in the short, suggesting along with the duration distributions that these two groups are truly long and short GRBs, or some sort of proxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since t-SNE works by comparing vectors dimension by dimension, it was crucial that each dimension actually meant the same for each burst. Unfortunately, there is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding exactly when a burst begins or ends, so the lightcurves where rarely aligned such that the first second of a given burst meant the same as the first second of any other burst. The trick behind getting this to work was shifting the bursts from the time domain into the frequency domain using the &amp;lsquo;Fourier Transform&amp;rsquo;, which eliminates temporal translational differences in the lightcurves and makes it possible to actually compare the bursts dimension by dimension!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running the machine learning algorithm on the Fourier transformed light curves let&amp;rsquo;s us get these two beautiful groups! TSNE GROUP FIGURE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the interesting things that came out of this project was to determine that those supernovae that we couldn&amp;rsquo;t find before go firmly in the group with all the other supernovae, so we&amp;rsquo;re pretty sure that they actually exploded, but the exact mechanism that led to an explosion with no visible supernova is still unknown. Professor Darach Watson at DAWN Copenhagen [link] currently has my favourite theory for why this is: Instead of the star exploding and then turning into a black hole, it would BOLD &amp;lsquo;implode&amp;rsquo; and turn directly into a black hole!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who wishes to do anything similar to this project is encourage to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...896L..20J/abstract&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;read the paper&lt;/a&gt; and check out the [Github](&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/astrockragh/GRB_TSNE&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://github.com/astrockragh/GRB_TSNE&lt;/a&gt;. Currently, we wish to extend this analysis to other observatories, getting thousands of new bursts included in the analysis!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Improving event reconstrution at IceCube</title>
      <link>https://astrockragh.github.io/project/neutrino_ml/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://astrockragh.github.io/project/neutrino_ml/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This Bachelors Thesis was done in collaboration with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Vinther901&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Jonas Vinther&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/JohannSeverin&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Johann Bock Severin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/JakobSchauser&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Jakob H. Schauser&lt;/a&gt; during our sixth semester as physics undergraduates. Check out their GitHubs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project was concerned with improving the reconstruction of neutrino events at The IceCube Neutrino Observatory, an experiment located at The South Pole, which aims to detect neutrinos and other particles in the ice sheet. Currently the observatory is focused on very very high energy neutrinos (TeV-PeV range) where the entire detector lights up and it is pretty easy to see where it came from, as can be seen in the video below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;1280&#34; height=&#34;720&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/vTya9hoKsfM&#34; title=&#34;High energy neutrino at IceCube&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;However, IceCube actually gets many more events at lower energies (GeV range), so we wanted to help improving the reconstruction at these energies. Here, only a few dots light up, and it is hard to figure out anything about the particle. As you may also be able to see in the video, this is further complicated by the fact that the IceCube detector has a somewhat odd two-layer hexagonal-cylindrical shape, which makes traditional algorithms almost impossible to use. We therefore turned to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which are very powerful when learning on geometric data. It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that grids are also special cases of graphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found superior performance compared to the algorithm currently used by IceCube, which about a factor of a million increase in speed. The project was so successful that a group of people at the Niels Bohr Institute are currently doing a full-scale project, which you can find on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/icecube/graphnet&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;IceCube official Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone has any questions, feel free to steal our code, read our report or reach out to me. The four different group members constructed four different model, varying from a few thousand parameters to multiple million, so this is also a great way of looking into model differences for the same task.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Point Spread Function improvement for COSMOS2020 survey</title>

&lt;p&gt;The COSMOS survey is one the longest-running galaxy surveys. Over two decades, we have collected observations of x-ray, optical, infrared, and radio light to obtain galaxy distances and understand their evolution over 13.7 billion years of cosmic history. &lt;a href=&#34;https://astroweaver.github.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;John R. Weaver&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cosmicdawn.dk/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Cosmic Dawn Center&lt;/a&gt; lead the 2020 edition of the master galaxy catalog, using bleeding-edge galaxy model-fitting techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worked with John to improve what astronomers call a Point Spread Function, or PSF for short, which essentially details how light becomes spread out and noisy as it moves through the atmosphere. As one might imagine, this isn&amp;rsquo;t the same across the night sky, due to the atmosphere being quite different when looking in different directions. As can be seen in the below figure, if one separates the night-sky into many smaller patches, giving each patch its own PSF, things are a lot better!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The COSMOS field has proved to be one of the cornerstone surveys in extragalactic astronomy. We have built a new photometric redshift catalog COSMOS2020 from the latest ultra-deep imaging from Subaru, VISTA, and Spitzer. We measure 1M sources across the 2 deg$^2$ field using both apertures and profile-fitting photometry, pairing each with two SED fitting codes to derive four sets of precise photometric redshifts. We then measure the form and evolution the Galaxy Stellar Mass Function from 0.2 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 7.5 to reveal a strikingly constant rate of mass assembly stretching back into the Epoch of Reionization. We also find new samples of ultra-luminous galaxies at z&amp;gt;7.5 which form the most robust constraints on the UV Luminosity Function at such early times, confirming an excess of luminous sources. Are we witnessing a stage before feedback has suppressed their growth? Such a scenario challenges galaxy formation theory. We will have our answer soon; five of these luminous z~9 galaxies will be followed up with spatially resolved spectroscopy in the Cycle 1 JWST NIRSpec program BEASTS (PI:John R. Weaver). I delve into the details of the PSF fitting and the cosmic variance analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Investigating Radius Increases in Hot Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://astrockragh.github.io/talk/aas_exoplanet/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Exoplanetary radii is the most commonly measured property of exoplanets, and thus our understanding of how to interpret any measured radius is crucial to the field. Atmospheric existence is often inferred from radius and mass observations, but this is based on the assumption that the interior of planets do not maintain most of the gravitational energy from their collapse. Recently, there have been doubts about this assumption. This project aims to investigate the potential consequences of planets retaining most of the energy from their collapse. Assuming the Murnaghan EOS, we find that stable rocky planets that maintain some of their gravitational energy can have sizeable radius increases, as much as 21% for a planet of 10 M⊕. Furthermore, limits on the amount of energy that can be maintained by a planet will be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
