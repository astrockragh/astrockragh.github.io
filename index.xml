      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project was done in collaboration with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Vinther901&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Jonas Vinther&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/JohannSeverin&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Johann Bock Severin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/JakobSchauser&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Jakob H. Schauser&lt;/a&gt; during our third semester as physics undergraduates. Check out their GitHubs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all branches of physics, new discoveries are made by identifying some signal peak upon a background of noise. In High Energy Physics, this could be the peak of a new particle found amongst the almost uncountable amount of collisions happening every second the Large Hadron Collider is running. Only a few collisions actually produce interesting particles. This makes it crucial to be able to classify which detections are part of the actual signal, and which are not. In this project we employed a range of statistical methods and machine learning algorithms to get the best estimate of the masses of different $V^0$ - particles, in both simulated data and real data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

The background is fitted with a third degree polynomial and a double Gaussian is used on the peak.&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As can be seen in the top figure, among some of the methods tried were simply doing some linear cuts in the feature space, found by simple annealing, using Fisher&amp;rsquo;s discriminant analysis, a simple decision tree and some boosted decision tree algorithms, of which XGBoost ended up being the method of choice. We ended up getting an accuracy of 99.7% for classyfing signal and background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most exciting thing from this project was the ability for our models to learn what a true label looked like in real data without having those labels. Overall, the LHC dataset is fantastic as a learning platform for both classification and regression problem.

      <title>Classifying Gamma-Ray Bursts into Two Classes using t-SNE</title>
      <link>https://astrockragh.github.io/project/tsne_grb/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://astrockragh.github.io/project/tsne_grb/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The duration of a gamma-ray burst (GRB) is a key indicator of its physical origin, with long bursts perhaps associated with the collapse of massive stars (also known as supernovae) and short bursts with mergers of neutron stars (kilonovae).
However, trying to categorize these events from the burst itself is very troublesome, as there is substantial overlap in the properties of both short and long GRBs and neither duration nor any other parameter so far considered completely separates the two groups [insert figure]. Some very long bursts even show up without any observble supernova, even when we know exactly where it came from, which even led people to propose extra classes of bursts, like the Extended Short Gamma Ray Burst, to explain the lack of a supernova. In this project, which was done by myself and my two good friends &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/JohannSeverin&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Johann Bock Severin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Vinther901&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Jonas Vinther&lt;/a&gt; as a semester project during our first year at the University of Copenhagen, we unambiguously classified every known GRB from the Swift Space observatory, using a dimensionality reduction algorithm, t-distributed stochastic neighborhood embedding, which had never been before and so was quite exciting. Although the classification takes place only using prompt emission light curves, every burst with an associated supernova is found in the longer group and bursts with kilonovae in the short, suggesting along with the duration distributions that these two groups are truly long and short GRBs, or some sort of proxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since t-SNE works by comparing vectors dimension by dimension, it was crucial that each dimension actually meant the same for each burst. Unfortunately, there is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding exactly when a burst begins or ends, so the lightcurves where rarely aligned such that the first second of a given burst meant the same as the first second of any other burst. The trick behind getting this to work was shifting the bursts from the time domain into the frequency domain using the &amp;lsquo;Fourier Transform&amp;rsquo;, which eliminates temporal translational differences in the lightcurves and makes it possible to actually compare the bursts dimension by dimension!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running the machine learning algorithm on the Fourier transformed light curves let&amp;rsquo;s us get these two beautiful groups! TSNE GROUP FIGURE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the interesting things that came out of this project was to determine that those supernovae that we couldn&amp;rsquo;t find before go firmly in the group with all the other supernovae, so we&amp;rsquo;re pretty sure that they actually exploded, but the exact mechanism that led to an explosion with no visible supernova is still unknown. Professor Darach Watson at DAWN Copenhagen [link] currently has my favourite theory for why this is: Instead of the star exploding and then turning into a black hole, it would BOLD &amp;lsquo;implode&amp;rsquo; and turn directly into a black hole!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who wishes to do anything similar to this project is encourage to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...896L..20J/abstract&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;read the paper&lt;/a&gt; and check out the [Github](&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/astrockragh/GRB_TSNE&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://github.com/astrockragh/GRB_TSNE&lt;/a&gt;. Currently, we wish to extend this analysis to other observatories, getting thousands of new bursts included in the analysis!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Improving event reconstrution at IceCube</title>
      <link>https://astrockragh.github.io/project/neutrino_ml/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://astrockragh.github.io/project/neutrino_ml/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This Bachelors Thesis was done in collaboration with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Vinther901&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Jonas Vinther&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/JohannSeverin&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Johann Bock Severin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/JakobSchauser&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Jakob H. Schauser&lt;/a&gt; during our sixth semester as physics undergraduates. Check out their GitHubs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project was concerned with improving the reconstruction of neutrino events at The IceCube Neutrino Observatory, an experiment located at The South Pole, which aims to detect neutrinos and other particles in the ice sheet. Currently the observatory is focused on very very high energy neutrinos (TeV-PeV range) where the entire detector lights up and it is pretty easy to see where it came from, as can be seen in the video below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;1280&#34; height=&#34;720&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/vTya9hoKsfM&#34; title=&#34;High energy neutrino at IceCube&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;However, IceCube actually gets many more events at lower energies (GeV range), so we wanted to help improving the reconstruction at these energies. Here, only a few dots light up, and it is hard to figure out anything about the particle. As you may also be able to see in the video, this is further complicated by the fact that the IceCube detector has a somewhat odd two-layer hexagonal-cylindrical shape, which makes traditional algorithms almost impossible to use. We therefore turned to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which are very powerful when learning on geometric data. It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that grids are also special cases of graphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found superior performance compared to the algorithm currently used by IceCube, which about a factor of a million increase in speed. The project was so successful that a group of people at the Niels Bohr Institute are currently doing a full-scale project, which you can find on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/icecube/graphnet&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;IceCube official Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone has any questions, feel free to steal our code, read our report or reach out to me. The four different group members constructed four different model, varying from a few thousand parameters to multiple million, so this is also a great way of looking into model differences for the same task.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Point Spread Function improvement for COSMOS2020 survey</title>
      <link>https://astrockragh.github.io/project/cosmos/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-two-catalogs-httpscosmos2020caletorg&#34;&gt;The two CATALOGS: &lt;a href=&#34;https://cosmos2020.calet.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://cosmos2020.calet.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The COSMOS survey is one the longest-running galaxy surveys. Over two decades, we have collected observations of x-ray, optical, infrared, and radio light to obtain galaxy distances and understand their evolution over 13.7 billion years of cosmic history. &lt;a href=&#34;https://astroweaver.github.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;John R. Weaver&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cosmicdawn.dk/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Cosmic Dawn Center&lt;/a&gt; lead the 2020 edition of the master galaxy catalog, using bleeding-edge galaxy model-fitting techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worked with John to improve what astronomers call a Point Spread Function, or PSF for short, which essentially details how light becomes spread out and noisy as it moves through the atmosphere. As one might imagine, this isn&amp;rsquo;t the same across the night sky, due to the atmosphere being quite different when looking in different directions. As can be seen in the below figure, if one separates the night-sky into many smaller patches, giving each patch its own PSF, things are a lot better!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to share some of the science that I and my collaborators do here, as well as some of the other cool stuff we get up to from time to time. There will also be some personal stuff on this webpage, but it will mainly center around big life updates and personal views on academic matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that you will be interested in sticking around and hope that this page proves helpful and that if you have any questions, ideas or other interesting things, that you reach out to me so that we can have a chat!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>COSMOS2020: New Insights into Galaxy Assembly and Evolution over the first 10 Billion Years</title>
      <link>https://astrockragh.github.io/talk/cosmos/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 31 Oct 2021 10:30:12 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://astrockragh.github.io/talk/cosmos/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The COSMOS field has proved to be one of the cornerstone surveys in extragalactic astronomy. We have built a new photometric redshift catalog COSMOS2020 from the latest ultra-deep imaging from Subaru, VISTA, and Spitzer. We measure 1M sources across the 2 deg$^2$ field using both apertures and profile-fitting photometry, pairing each with two SED fitting codes to derive four sets of precise photometric redshifts. We then measure the form and evolution the Galaxy Stellar Mass Function from 0.2 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 7.5 to reveal a strikingly constant rate of mass assembly stretching back into the Epoch of Reionization. We also find new samples of ultra-luminous galaxies at z&amp;gt;7.5 which form the most robust constraints on the UV Luminosity Function at such early times, confirming an excess of luminous sources. Are we witnessing a stage before feedback has suppressed their growth? Such a scenario challenges galaxy formation theory. We will have our answer soon; five of these luminous z~9 galaxies will be followed up with spatially resolved spectroscopy in the Cycle 1 JWST NIRSpec program BEASTS (PI:John R. Weaver). I delve into the details of the PSF fitting and the cosmic variance analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;code-highlighting&#34;&gt;Code Highlighting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inline code: &lt;code&gt;variable&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code block:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In-line math: $x + y = z$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Block math:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
