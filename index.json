Predictions for planned and proposed surveys have typically focused on average galaxy counts, assuming a random distribution of galaxies across the observed field. The first and most-massive galaxies, however, are expected to be tightly clustered, which can be quantified through an effect known as cosmic variance. We show that cosmic variance is likely to be the dominant contribution to uncertainty for high-redshift mass and luminosity functions, and that median high-redshift and high-mass galaxy counts for planned observations lie significantly below average counts. Several different strategies are considered for improving our understanding of the first galaxies, including adding depth, area, and independent pointings. Adding independent pointings is shown to be the most efficient both for discovering the single highest-redshift galaxy and also for constraining mass and luminosity functions.\n","date":1698019200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1698019200,"objectID":"1b7d94ebb11a25bb89ed7519b938f67b","permalink":"https://astrockragh.github.io/project/high_z_jwst/","publishdate":"2023-10-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/high_z_jwst/","section":"project","summary":"We show that the highest redshift galaxies detected with the James Webb Space Telescope, will have a highly skewed distribution due to galaxy clustering, which can be quantified through an effect known as **cosmic variance**.","tags":["Galaxies","Cosmology"],"title":"The highest redshift galaxy we will find with JWST","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"   First of all, I’ve written two versions of this post, this one is a little easier to understand (less jargon) and more fun! The other version can be found under “Research”.\nMotivation When scientists discover something, there are three main things that we tend to ask ourselves.\n What is the building blocks of that thing? What is keeping the building blocks together in that particular structure? How did the thing get assembled?  One can think of it sort of like getting a new thing from IKEA. We discover a new object, say a galaxy, and it feels like we have discovered a new item in the IKEA catalogue that is our world.\n   But now we want to investigate it a bit more. We want to answer our three questions, and for that we just need to open the box and find the assembly manual, within which we find:\n What parts is included for building our galaxy, i.e. the building blocks. For galaxies this would be some stars, some dark matter, some gas and so on. What tools are included to build our galaxy. For our galaxy we mainly just need one screwdriver, gravity. The instructions for how to use our tools to put together our parts.  Question 1 is actually not as simple as it looks. When we go out and look at galaxies, we see that there seems to a building block that affects the galaxy a lot, but that we cannot see. This is what we call dark matter. While dark matter is weird, it is also quite simple. As far as we can tell, it only interacts with other things through gravity, but it is still fundamental to how galaxies end up being. This is because it collapses under its own gravity and makes gravitational wells where galaxies can form. These collapsed clumps are called halos.\nQuestion 3 is by far the most complicated when it comes to galaxies, because it is really hard to observe. Galaxies evolve over v e r y long timescales. Luckily, we have simulations we can investigate this with. There are a couple of key problems with the simulations though.\n They are computationally expensive. They are hard interpret/understand.  Making a model that emulates a simulation can solve problem 1 and give a lot of new insights into problem 2. So that is what we have done by building Mangrove. Mangrove is a Machine Learning based emulator that takes into account all three core aspects of galaxy formations, building blocks, tools and assembly manual, to give us better galaxies faster.\nTechnical stuff First of all, we don’t completely bypass the simulation step, since we still need to run a simulation, but only one with nothing but dark matter. Because dark matter is so simple, this can be done pretty quickly. Then, once we have that simulation, we can try to “paint” galaxies on top of the dark matter. This is by no means the first time this has been attempted, but earlier papers have only included features from the final time step of the simulation as their input to their model. This essentially means that these methods can learn answers to questions 1 and 2 (current building blocks/tools), but are agnostic about the assembly of the galaxies. Mangrove improves on this by using not just the final time step, but an encoding of the temporal evolution of the dark matter known as a merger tree.\nThe merger tree is made by simply stopping the simulation at different time steps and identifying the halos where we know that galaxies live. We then see which halos merge with other halos from timestep to timestep, and build a tree-like structure encoding this evolution (see Fig. 1).\n Fig.1 - Running a simulation and identifying halos at different time steps allows us to build the merger tree, which can then easily be encoded as a graph.   We can then encode the merger tree as a mathematical graph, which in this context simply means a collection of nodes and edges, where each node represents a halo, and the edges determine how they have interacted with each other over time. When we have the graphs we can use a Graph Neural Network (GNN), to learn how the galaxies pertaining to those merger trees should be.\nIn order to build an emulator, we also have to find something to emulate.

The other version can be found under “Blog posts”.\nEfficiently mapping baryonic properties onto dark matter is a major challenge in astrophysics. Although semi-analytic models (SAMs)1 and hydrodynamical simulations have made impressive advances in reproducing galaxy observables across cosmologically significant volumes, these methods still require significant computation times, representing a barrier to many applications.\nSome advances have been made thanks to Machine Learning models, which learn mappings between the much less expensive dark matter only simulations and baryonic galaxy properties. However, these ML emulators still lack a lot of precision, and provide only few insights into the processes that they emulate! This is mainly because they try to map directly between dark matter halos and galaxies, ignoring formation and environmental effects.\nIn this project, we improved on both the precision and interpretability of previous work in the field, by including the formation history and showing that when it comes to nature versus nurture for galaxies, nurture matters a lot!\nWe do so by introducing Mangrove, a Graph Neural Network which works on merger trees, which encode the formation history of the dark matter halo.\nMangrove is twice as precise as other ML models, and allows us to put galaxies into dark matter simulations between 104 and 109 times faster than a SAM and IllustrisTNG codes, respectively.\n   Technical stuff First of all, we don’t completely bypass the simulation step, since we still need to run a simulation, but only one with nothing but dark matter.

After doing a couple of these message passing steps, we then sum over all halos in the merger tree and use yet another learnable function h, that decodes this sum and predicts the aspects of galaxies that we are interested in, such as the total mass of the stars in the galaxy, the mass of the black hole at the center and the amount of cold gas, as well as the uncertainties on these quantities.\nResults How much better does Mangrove do compared to methods you ask?\nWell, let’s compare how well assign stellar masses to halos work with different methods!\nThe first comparison is with the traditional method for assigning galaxy properties based on their dark matter halos, Abundance Matching.

In High Energy Physics, this could be the peak of a new particle found amongst the almost uncountable amount of collisions happening every second the Large Hadron Collider is running. Only a few collisions actually produce interesting particles. This makes it crucial to be able to classify which detections are part of the actual signal, and which are not.

However, trying to categorize these events from the burst itself is very troublesome, as there is substantial overlap in the properties of both short and long GRBs and neither duration nor any other parameter so far considered completely separates the two groups [insert figure]. Some very long bursts even show up without any observble supernova, even when we know exactly where it came from, which even led people to propose extra classes of bursts, like the Extended Short Gamma Ray Burst, to explain the lack of a supernova. In this project, which was done by myself and my two good friends Johann Bock Severin and Jonas Vinther as a semester project during our first year at the University of Copenhagen, we unambiguously classified every known GRB from the Swift Space observatory, using a dimensionality reduction algorithm, t-distributed stochastic neighborhood embedding, which had never been before and so was quite exciting. Although the classification takes place only using prompt emission light curves, every burst with an associated supernova is found in the longer group and bursts with kilonovae in the short, suggesting along with the duration distributions that these two groups are truly long and short GRBs, or some sort of proxy.\nSince t-SNE works by comparing vectors dimension by dimension, it was crucial that each dimension actually meant the same for each burst. Unfortunately, there is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding exactly when a burst begins or ends, so the lightcurves where rarely aligned such that the first second of a given burst meant the same as the first second of any other burst. The trick behind getting this to work was shifting the bursts from the time domain into the frequency domain using the ‘Fourier Transform’, which eliminates temporal translational differences in the lightcurves and makes it possible to actually compare the bursts dimension by dimension!\nRunning the machine learning algorithm on the Fourier transformed light curves let’s us get these two beautiful groups! TSNE GROUP FIGURE\nOne of the interesting things that came out of this project was to determine that those supernovae that we couldn’t find before go firmly in the group with all the other supernovae, so we’re pretty sure that they actually exploded, but the exact mechanism that led to an explosion with no visible supernova is still unknown. Professor Darach Watson at DAWN Copenhagen [link] currently has my favourite theory for why this is: Instead of the star exploding and then turning into a black hole, it would BOLD ‘implode’ and turn directly into a black hole!\nAnyone who wishes to do anything similar to this project is encourage to read the paper and check out the [Github](https://github.com/astrockragh/GRB_TSNE.

Currently the observatory is focused on very very high energy neutrinos (TeV-PeV range) where the entire detector lights up and it is pretty easy to see where it came from, as can be seen in the video below.\n. However, IceCube actually gets many more events at lower energies (GeV range), so we wanted to help improving the reconstruction at these energies. Here, only a few dots light up, and it is hard to figure out anything about the particle. As you may also be able to see in the video, this is further complicated by the fact that the IceCube detector has a somewhat odd two-layer hexagonal-cylindrical shape, which makes traditional algorithms almost impossible to use. We therefore turned to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which are very powerful when learning on geometric data. It’s worth noting that grids are also special cases of graphs.\nWe found superior performance compared to the algorithm currently used by IceCube, which about a factor of a million increase in speed. The project was so successful that a group of people at the Niels Bohr Institute are currently doing a full-scale project, which you can find on the IceCube official Github.\nIf anyone has any questions, feel free to steal our code, read our report or reach out to me. The four different group members constructed four different model, varying from a few thousand parameters to multiple million, so this is also a great way of looking into model differences for the same task.\n","date":1642636800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642636800,"objectID":"b60a3ba1df2983dcc28229391386de62","permalink":"https://astrockragh.github.io/project/neutrino_ml/","publishdate":"2022-01-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/neutrino_ml/","section":"project","summary":"Using Graph Neural Networks, me and a group of friends showed that event reconstruction speed and precision for low-energy neutrino events can be greatly improved.","tags":["Machine Learning","Particle Physics","Cosmology"],"title":"Improving event reconstrution at IceCube","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The two CATALOGS: https://cosmos2020.calet.org/ The COSMOS survey is one the longest-running galaxy surveys.

As one might imagine, this isn’t the same across the night sky, due to the atmosphere being quite different when looking in different directions. As can be seen in the below figure, if one separates the night-sky into many smaller patches, giving each patch its own PSF, things are a lot better!\n   ","date":1642636800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642636800,"objectID":"e32251862750f8d3cde649bd390f751a","permalink":"https://astrockragh.github.io/project/cosmos/","publishdate":"2022-01-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/cosmos/","section":"project","summary":"Solving the issue of spatially varying PSFs for the COSMOS survey","tags":["Galaxies","Cosmology","Observations"],"title":"Point Spread Function improvement for COSMOS2020 survey","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1636885812,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1636885812,"objectID":"843919f7a4ee2812c31ba32136135dfb","permalink":"https://astrockragh.github.io/talk/highz_gal/","publishdate":"2021-11-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/highz_gal/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["contributed"],"title":"Finding High Redshift galaxies with JWST","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"The COSMOS field has proved to be one of the cornerstone surveys in extragalactic astronomy.
