Schauser during our third semester as physics undergraduates. Check out their GitHubs!\nIn all branches of physics, new discoveries are made by identifying some signal peak upon a background of noise. In High Energy Physics, this could be the peak of a new particle found amongst the almost uncountable amount of collisions happening every second the Large Hadron Collider is running. Only a few collisions actually produce interesting particles. This makes it crucial to be able to classify which detections are part of the actual signal, and which are not. In this project we employed a range of statistical methods and machine learning algorithms to get the best estimate of the masses of different $V^0$ - particles, in both simulated data and real data.\n   As can be seen in the top figure, among some of the methods tried were simply doing some linear cuts in the feature space, found by simple annealing, using Fisher’s discriminant analysis, a simple decision tree and some boosted decision tree algorithms, of which XGBoost ended up being the method of choice. We ended up getting an accuracy of 99.7% for classyfing signal and background.\nPerhaps the most exciting thing from this project was the ability for our models to learn what a true label looked like in real data without having those labels. Overall, the LHC dataset is fantastic as a learning platform for both classification and regression problem. If you would like to get involved, reach out to Troels C. Petersen.

However, trying to categorize these events from the burst itself is very troublesome, as there is substantial overlap in the properties of both short and long GRBs and neither duration nor any other parameter so far considered completely separates the two groups [insert figure]. Some very long bursts even show up without any observble supernova, even when we know exactly where it came from, which even led people to propose extra classes of bursts, like the Extended Short Gamma Ray Burst, to explain the lack of a supernova. In this project, which was done by myself and my two good friends Johann Bock Severin and Jonas Vinther as a semester project during our first year at the University of Copenhagen, we unambiguously classified every known GRB from the Swift Space observatory, using a dimensionality reduction algorithm, t-distributed stochastic neighborhood embedding, which had never been before and so was quite exciting. Although the classification takes place only using prompt emission light curves, every burst with an associated supernova is found in the longer group and bursts with kilonovae in the short, suggesting along with the duration distributions that these two groups are truly long and short GRBs, or some sort of proxy.\nSince t-SNE works by comparing vectors dimension by dimension, it was crucial that each dimension actually meant the same for each burst. Unfortunately, there is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding exactly when a burst begins or ends, so the lightcurves where rarely aligned such that the first second of a given burst meant the same as the first second of any other burst. The trick behind getting this to work was shifting the bursts from the time domain into the frequency domain using the ‘Fourier Transform’, which eliminates temporal translational differences in the lightcurves and makes it possible to actually compare the bursts dimension by dimension!\nRunning the machine learning algorithm on the Fourier transformed light curves let’s us get these two beautiful groups! TSNE GROUP FIGURE\nOne of the interesting things that came out of this project was to determine that those supernovae that we couldn’t find before go firmly in the group with all the other supernovae, so we’re pretty sure that they actually exploded, but the exact mechanism that led to an explosion with no visible supernova is still unknown. Professor Darach Watson at DAWN Copenhagen [link] currently has my favourite theory for why this is: Instead of the star exploding and then turning into a black hole, it would BOLD ‘implode’ and turn directly into a black hole!\nAnyone who wishes to do anything similar to this project is encourage to read the paper and check out the [Github](https://github.com/astrockragh/GRB_TSNE.

Check out their GitHubs!\nThis project was concerned with improving the reconstruction of neutrino events at The IceCube Neutrino Observatory, an experiment located at The South Pole, which aims to detect neutrinos and other particles in the ice sheet. Currently the observatory is focused on very very high energy neutrinos (TeV-PeV range) where the entire detector lights up and it is pretty easy to see where it came from, as can be seen in the video below.\n. However, IceCube actually gets many more events at lower energies (GeV range), so we wanted to help improving the reconstruction at these energies. Here, only a few dots light up, and it is hard to figure out anything about the particle. As you may also be able to see in the video, this is further complicated by the fact that the IceCube detector has a somewhat odd two-layer hexagonal-cylindrical shape, which makes traditional algorithms almost impossible to use. We therefore turned to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which are very powerful when learning on geometric data. It’s worth noting that grids are also special cases of graphs.\nWe found superior performance compared to the algorithm currently used by IceCube, which about a factor of a million increase in speed. The project was so successful that a group of people at the Niels Bohr Institute are currently doing a full-scale project, which you can find on the IceCube official Github.\nIf anyone has any questions, feel free to steal our code, read our report or reach out to me. The four different group members constructed four different model, varying from a few thousand parameters to multiple million, so this is also a great way of looking into model differences for the same task.\n","date":1642636800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642636800,"objectID":"b60a3ba1df2983dcc28229391386de62","permalink":"https://astrockragh.github.io/project/neutrino_ml/","publishdate":"2022-01-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/neutrino_ml/","section":"project","summary":"Using Graph Neural Networks, me and a group of friends showed that event reconstruction speed and precision for low-energy neutrino events can be greatly improved.","tags":["Machine Learning","Particle Physics","Cosmology"],"title":"Improving event reconstrution at IceCube","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The two CATALOGS: https://cosmos2020.calet.org/ The COSMOS survey is one the longest-running galaxy surveys.

Atmospheric existence is often inferred from radius and mass observations, but this is based on the assumption that the interior of planets do not maintain most of the gravitational energy from their collapse. Recently, there have been doubts about this assumption. This project aims to investigate the potential consequences of planets retaining most of the energy from their collapse. Assuming the Murnaghan EOS, we find that stable rocky planets that maintain some of their gravitational energy can have sizeable radius increases, as much as 21% for a planet of 10 M⊕. Furthermore, limits on the amount of energy that can be maintained by a planet will be discussed.\n","date":1578268800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578268800,"objectID":"ef86d712d80594768799f75edc40b3d8","permalink":"https://astrockragh.github.io/talk/aas_exoplanet/","publishdate":"2021-10-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/aas_exoplanet/","section":"talk","summary":"Exoplanetary radii is the most commonly measured property of exoplanets, and thus our understanding of how to interpret any measured radius is crucial to the field. Atmospheric existence is often inferred from radius and mass observations, but this is based on the assumption that the interior of planets do not maintain most of the gravitational energy from their collapse.","tags":["contributed"],"title":"Investigating Radius Increases in Hot Exoplanets","type":"talk"},{"authors":["C.
