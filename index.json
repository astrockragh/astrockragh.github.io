One consequence of this assumption is that different wavelength ranges carry little information about each other, since the different components dominate emission at different wavelengths. This common assumption of separability is implicitly embedded in galaxy spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting codes, which are broadly used to derive the physical parameters of galaxies. In this paper, we show that optical spectra can be used to predict near- and mid-infrared photometry to $\\chi^2_N \\approx 1$, in strong contrast with SED fitting codes. We also demonstrate that derived quantities such as the bolometric luminosity of active galactic nuclei (AGN) can empirically be tightly constrained from the optical, just as dust parameters such as $\\mathrm{q_{PAH}}$. We investigate the shortcomings of the separability assumption in SED fitting codes, finding that it leads to biases and imprecision in parameter inference. We construct a tool for determining the most important areas of improvement for SED models.","tags":["contributed"],"title":"Challenging modelling assumptions by connecting the optical and IR @CCA","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"A question that many astronomers often ask is whether a given person is an observer or a theorist. This bimodal view of our discipline is quite outdated, but nonetheless persistent. Below I give a short overview of some of the considerations people make when evaluating my position in the field, considerations that I make when answering the question, and how I see my own role.\nWhy some consider me a theorist My first series of papers in graduate school (on galaxy formation histories and environments) were all done starting from simulation data, which shaped the early talks I gave to scientific audiences, and therefore this view of me as a theorist.\nFurthermore, most of the people in the field of AstroxML (machine learning applied to astronomy) tend to mainly use simulated data products to tune their models, which land them in the “theory”-bin, and so do I, by association.\nThis view is mainly wrong because, well, I really do not like using simulated data as a first approach. Philosophically, I am an empiricist, meaning that I am only really interested in things that can be measured in the real world, and I spend a lot of time taking, improving, and using real data from real instruments.\nBut… then, I must be an observer?\nWhy some consider me an observer The majority of my time at Princeton and at the University of Copenhagen has been focused on observations. My first paper was on empirically classifying gamma-ray bursts, then I worked on measuring and forecasting cosmic variance for JWST, writing proposals for JWST, calibrating point-spread functions for COSMOS2020, then on observing neutrinos with IceCube. This work has continued while at Princeton, where I have been CoI on a couple of succesful JWST proposals, and thought some more about cosmic variance.\nHowever, my biggest claim to being an observer has come from the times I have actually physically been observing (which I where the picture at the top of the post is from), as well as my +3 year-involvement in the engineering/commissioning teams for the Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) and its auxilliary telescope, the Subaru Night Sky Spectrograph (SuNSS).\nBut… if I am on the engineering team, does that not mean that I do instrumentation then?\nWhy some consider me an instrumentalist This is perhaps the easiest view to neglect, but it has happened that people think I only do instrumentation. This comes from the fact that I spend a good part of my time worrying about software (wavelength/flux calibration) and hardware (fiber connectors) for massively multiplexed spectrographs like PFS. However, as of now, most of what I do for these instruments is to study the airglow, the intrinsic emission of the night sky, and using what we find to improve the performance. Therefore, I do not really qualify as a real instrumentalist.\nSo if I do not fit into these bins, do I even really count as an astrophysicist?\nWhy some do not consider me an astrophysicist at all A view I have encountered from a few (mainly older) people, is that what I do has nothing to do with “real astrophysics”. This view mainly comes from people who hear that I care about statistics and machine learning, and therefore classify me as a kind of lost computer scientist.\nOf course, my interest in statistics and machine learning really comes from their applicability for real, physical problems, so I am definitely not just a computer scientist who got lost.\nBut what am I then?\nMy profile as I see it My academic profile is a bit weird, mostly because it is very multi-faceted. This makes some people a bit uncomfortable, because they cannot quite nail me down, but I really like having an eclectic profile! The possibility for being broad is one of the main reasons I fell in love with astrophysics to begin with!\nI also think of astrophysics as being a fundamentally composite science, in need of broad skill-sets, and when I look at the true greats of the field, I see people who skillfully spanned everything from theory to hardware-building.1\nOf course, I do not span everything, so I have tried to summarise how I see my skill-set as of October 3rd, 2024. The results can be seen in the above radar graph.\n   This will surely change over the years. However, I will always love measuring things. Astrophysics is only a science because we measure real things with real instruments. It is in real data that the true wonders of the universe lie.\n  Think of people like Jim Gunn, who made fundamental contributions to everything he touched! ↩︎\n   ","date":1727949600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1727913600,"objectID":"0ae05ac976a9c432894759154addecee","permalink":"https://astrockragh.github.io/post/theory_observer/","publishdate":"2024-10-03T10:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/theory_observer/","section":"post","summary":"Many people ask me if I am a theorist or an observer, and the answer is always a bit of a mess.

There are many ways of doing this, for example, if all we are interested is in pictures or photometry, we can take a single, ultra-high-resolution picture, and then analyze subdivisions later. This is the approach taken by the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). However, if we want detailed spectra (light split up wavelength with high resolution), the most information-rich data type in astronomy, we must do things differently.\nFor the Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) on the Subaru Telescope, we do multi-object spectroscopy using optical fibers. This means that we focus the light from the area we are observing onto 2400 separate points, connected to optical fibers to lead them to our spectrograph. Now we can treat this as 2400 separate spectra, but we get them all at the same time! So if we want to take spectra of 2400 galaxies for half an hour each, a series of observations that would previously have taken 100 nights, we just get all of them in the same half hour! So now we can observe many millions of targets. You can see the focal plane (where we focus the light), with our 2400 fibers, in the picture below. One of the cool things about this is that we need to be able to move the fibers a bit to get them to follow the targets we want to observe, and this is done by tiny robots, called cobras. A cool video of them moving can be found by clicking this link.\n   So now we know that we can observe a lot of galaxies. How about 2)? The first you want to do is to get a big telescope! With PFS, we are lucky to have access to the very large Subaru Telescope, situated on Mauna Kea at an altitude of 4,139 m (13,579 ft) in Hawai’i, USA.1 When you read very large, it can be hard to understand just how large, so here’s a picture of me (~1.8 m/~6ft tall) standing at the bottom of it.\n   The primary mirror is 8.2 m (320 inches) in diameter, one of the biggest in the world! The area of the mirror is twice that of the JWST Space Telescope. Building very large telescopes is one of the great advantages of having them on the ground, compared to in space. However, when we are on the ground, we have to deal with one of the things which scare astronomers the most…\n👻 The atmosphere 👻\nSo why is the atmosphere scary? There are three main reasons:\n The atmosphere makes it hard to focus on distant objects. This is because air moves, which spreads out the light, so that something coming from a single point gets spread out over a large area. The atmosphere absorbs light, making our targets fainter.  And now, the biggest problem for PFS.\n The atmosphere emits light itself, glowing with light we call airglow. When we look at anything from the ground, we always observe both the airglow and the target.  The airglow is a problem because airglow is both bright and variable. Below, you can see an example of a simulated2 galaxy spectrum, split up into sky and galaxy counterparts. It is clear that the galaxy is dominated by the airglow. The galaxy shown here is actually quite bright, the main PFS targets will be 100 times fainter, so detecting any galaxy component is really hard! Searching for galaxies from the ground is like searching for a tiny firefly behind a giant stadium light!\n   One exciting aspect of the airglow is that it actually is the same thing as aurora. In the above plot, the strong lines at 557 nm and 630 nm are actually the green and red light we see during aurora (look at the top of the article!). They are always there, but when we are not being hit by a solar storm, you cannot quite see them with the naked eye. However, as you may already have noticed, most of the airglow comes out in the infrared (IR), so if our eyes could see in the IR (wavelengths above 700 nm), we would have aurora all the time!\nWhile this would definitely be spectacular, it also poses a major problem for ground-based astronomy, as can be seen in the above figure. So in order to observe faint galaxies from the ground, we must get really good at a process known as sky subtraction. As the name suggests, this is the process with which we subtract the airglow from our spectra. However, this requires knowing how the airglow was at the same time that the observation was taken. This is usually done by taking some of our 2400 fibers and pointing them towards blank pieces of sky. If we let fiber A point at a galaxy, we will observe (galaxy+airglow)A, and if we let fiber B point at a blank piece of sky, we will observe (airglow)B. Taking (galaxy+airglow)A-(airglow)B will then give is the clean galaxy spectrum, galaxyA.\nDoing this efficiently requires understanding the airglow.

This was motivated by the surprising abundance of massive objects observed with JWST, which challenged all galaxy formation models and even had some people questioning our cosmological model. However, the first analyses of this potential tension was done without much regard for potential subleties, something we attempted to mitigate in this paper. A major issue with many studies is that they often overlook an important factor: cosmic variance. This refers to the uneven clustering of galaxies across different parts of the sky (see the above figure), which causes the number of galaxies observed in a given area to vary more than you’d expect from simple Poisson statistics. In essence, certain regions may systematically have more or fewer galaxies just because of where you’re looking, and this systematic is a big effect in the very early universe.\nCosmic variance becomes even more pronounced when you look at galaxies that are very massive, at high redshifts, or when observing small areas of the sky — just like in the deep surveys conducted by JWST. These narrow and deep surveys targeting the earliest, most massive galaxies, are especially vulnerable to the effects of cosmic variance.\nIn this paper, we developed a model to predict the distribution of mass of the most massive galaxies in given JWST surveys, taking the cosmic variance into account. The model shows that previous methods, which relied on idealized Extreme Value Statistics, don’t fully capture the actual distribution. Instead, the new predictions reveal some surprising differences, both in the position and shape of the distribution of the largest galaxies, as can be see. The results were a little counterintuitive at first, but upon further reflection, they offer a more accurate picture of what we should expect to (and do) find in these surveys! This is shown in the below figure, where the yellow contours (including cosmic variance) can clearly be seen to greatly diverge from the green contours (no cosmic variance), at high redshift.\n   To test the models validity, we used simulations from UniverseMachine (see the red contours in the figure above), an empirically calibrated tool designed to simulate galaxy formation in the universe. Sure enough, the predicted effects of cosmic variance stood out clearly, showing that it has a major impact on the most massive galaxies we may observe, in exactly the way our simple model predicted!\nAnother key finding was that cosmic variance estimators are affected by a “variance on the variance” in a way that has so far been neglected. The uncertainty in the cosmic variance itself is highly non-Gaussian in the limit where the cosmic variance itself is high, and we both prove it and empirically measure the effect. The proof can be checked out in the paper, but the result is shown in the below figure!\n   Ultimately, the study underscores the importance of properly considering cosmic variance when interpreting the results of galaxy surveys, especially when trying to reconcile the existence of extreme galaxies in the early universe with existing galaxy formation models. Without doing so, we may be misinterpreting the true nature of the early universe. The effects for a few sample cases can be seen below.\n   ","date":1727740800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1727740800,"objectID":"9ce91661f11b343d9aea9ab41252ba03","permalink":"https://astrockragh.github.io/project/most_massive_jwst/","publishdate":"2024-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/most_massive_jwst/","section":"project","summary":"We show that cosmic variance must be accounted for in analyses of extremely massive galaxies in high-z JWST surveys, and provide tools and considerations for doing so.","tags":["Galaxies","Cosmology"],"title":"The most massive galaxy we will find with JWST at high redshift","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1727439300,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1727439300,"objectID":"eed8098b8c275212075af605c604fff5","permalink":"https://astrockragh.github.io/talk/2024_boulder/","publishdate":"2024-09-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2024_boulder/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["Invited"],"title":"New perspectives in galaxy formation @CU Boulder","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1725538500,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1725538500,"objectID":"af07d299909b367ee463de64b74f8cb0","permalink":"https://astrockragh.github.io/talk/2024_thunch/","publishdate":"2024-09-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2024_thunch/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["Invited"],"title":"Challenging modelling assumptions by connecting the optical and IR @Princeton","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1722600900,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1722600900,"objectID":"45e7b1b71028032d431b703dad0bae5b","permalink":"https://astrockragh.github.io/talk/2024_ucsc/","publishdate":"2024-09-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2024_ucsc/","section":"talk","summary":"Galaxies are conventionally thought of as composites of physically distinct components, making the components separable.

In this paper, we show that optical spectra can be used to predict near- and mid-infrared photometry to $\\chi^2_N \\approx 1$, in strong contrast with SED fitting codes. We also demonstrate that derived quantities such as the bolometric luminosity of active galactic nuclei (AGN) can empirically be tightly constrained from the optical, just as dust parameters such as $\\mathrm{q_{PAH}}$.

Wu at STScI/JHU, and it was a joy to work with him on this! Now on to the research. The projects were started during the great KITP program on Data-Driven Astronomy, taking my earlier work on the connection between galaxies and their formation histories. A natural follow-up question is whether we can find similar improvements in our modelling of galaxies by exploiting their environments instead of their formation histories. We therefore dive into the intricate relationship between galaxies, dark matter halos, and their large-scale cosmic environments using data from the Illustris TNG300 hydrodynamic simulation. To better understand these connections, we tested two machine learning (ML) models: Explainable Boosting Machines (EBMs) and E(3)-invariant graph neural networks (GNNs). We use GNNs to make sure that we capture the full information in the cosmic web, instead of realying on summary statistics, an approach which we know did not work for analyzing formation histories! The E(3)-invariance, means that the functions we learned are made explicitly invariant to Euclidean transfomations in 3D, meaning all translations, rotations, and reflections in 3D.\nOne of the main issues with analyzing environments is that the connections between different galaxies are not given a priori. We therefore must pick a subjective length scale, within which we consider galaxies “connected”. We must then tune this linking length (L), to give us the best results, and see what we can learn from this tuning. In the below plot, I show how graph structures that result from changing linking lengths.\n   We now test our GNNs and our EBMs with a summary statistic that summarizes information on the same length scale as that used by the GNN. The summary statistic we choose is the spherically averaged overdensity, in simple terms, the total amount of mass within a ball of radius L, centered on each galaxy. In summary we have two model, trained to predict the stellar masses starting from dark matter, the GNN using the dark matter halo, and those around it, and the EBM using the halo and the total amount of mass around it. Differences between the two are therefore only due to treatments in environment. The plot below shows our results as a function of linking length. The y-axis shows the reconstruction error, so lower is better!\n   First, we see that the GNN (purple) is way better than anything else, including the EBM (blue)! So once again, summary statistics are not the way to go, and GNNs are really powerful! However, there is also interesting structure in the plot. The GNN keeps getting better with each increase of the linking length at the same rate until at 3 Mpc, and then it levels off, but to another fixed rate! There seems to be something special about this length scale, since the behaviour of our model is essentially in one mode below 3 Mpc, and another above!\nIf we look at the performance of the EBM, we also see a conspicuous curve with its best performance at a the same length scale!. The 3 Mpc scale is clearly special!\n   However, it’s also worth noting that the GNNs were able to pick up on environmental influences from larger scales—up to 10 Mpc—showing that there’s more to the galaxy–halo connection than just nearby density.\nOne thing that we found quite amusing while doing this project was that many people who work with the cosmic web (large-scale positioning of galaxies) were very adamant that we would fail if we did not use this special algorithm called DisPerSE, which is supposed to provide an advanced topological description of the cosmic web, instead of just connecting things within a given length. However, we found that these simple spherical density measures were more useful than more complex cosmic web distance features derived from the DisPerSE algorithm (green line in the above plot).\n   ","date":1722556800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1722556800,"objectID":"fcb98f7cc9194bf597eb2a44c1df973f","permalink":"https://astrockragh.github.io/project/gnn_environment/","publishdate":"2024-08-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/gnn_environment/","section":"project","summary":"We use Graph Neural Networks to determine how galaxies relate to their environments, and determine a special neighbourhood length scale which shape galaxies the most.","tags":["Galaxies","Machine Learning","Cosmology"],"title":"The galaxy-environment connection revealed by Graph Neural Networks","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"This summer school lecture included two notebook tutorials, which can be found here:\nNotebook 1: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1K6fvzUP33UWkXWoYxi5nt1ITwjXYHm5t\nNotebook 2: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zOxLB5QQAVqfR6FIjQ3YTRnRy0rGGaBO\n","date":1719576900,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1719576900,"objectID":"dff4dd59d5a8c69a37103dea490239ac","permalink":"https://astrockragh.github.io/talk/2024_montreal_summer_school/","publishdate":"2024-04-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2024_montreal_summer_school/","section":"talk","summary":"This summer school lecture included two notebook tutorials, which can be found here:\nNotebook 1: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1K6fvzUP33UWkXWoYxi5nt1ITwjXYHm5t\nNotebook 2: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zOxLB5QQAVqfR6FIjQ3YTRnRy0rGGaBO","tags":["Invited"],"title":"Graphs Neural Networks, @Montréal Astro x ML Summer School","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1716552900,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1716552900,"objectID":"20e4a21217d9314f44d9115273d2542d","permalink":"https://astrockragh.github.io/talk/2024_subaru/","publishdate":"2024-05-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2024_subaru/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["invited"],"title":"Airglow and the Subaru Night Sky Spectrograph (SuNSS) @Subaru Telescope","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1712232900,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1712232900,"objectID":"fa3054ad46b2359ef310bdaf2cece1e3","permalink":"https://astrockragh.github.io/talk/2024_montreal_ciela/","publishdate":"2024-04-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2024_montreal_ciela/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["Invited"],"title":"Galaxies, their dark matter environments, and formation histories @Montréal, Ciela Institute","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1711714500,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1711714500,"objectID":"1fff87bcad4b80e369117deab8882ded","permalink":"https://astrockragh.github.io/talk/2024_cca_most_massive/","publishdate":"2024-03-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2024_cca_most_massive/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["Invited"],"title":"The most massive galaxy in the universe @CCA","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1704802500,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704802500,"objectID":"2935940d5de7363ef41f582f0d2bd0fc","permalink":"https://astrockragh.github.io/talk/2024_aas/","publishdate":"2024-01-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2024_aas/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["contributed"],"title":"Airglow and the Subaru Night Sky Spectrograph (SuNSS) @AAS 243th","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"One of the primary goals for the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope is to observe the first galaxies.

The other version can be found under “Research”.\nMotivation When scientists discover something, there are three main things that we tend to ask ourselves.\n What is the building blocks of that thing? What is keeping the building blocks together in that particular structure? How did the thing get assembled?  One can think of it sort of like getting a new thing from IKEA. We discover a new object, say a galaxy, and it feels like we have discovered a new item in the IKEA catalogue that is our world.\n   But now we want to investigate it a bit more. We want to answer our three questions, and for that we just need to open the box and find the assembly manual, within which we find:\n What parts is included for building our galaxy, i.e. the building blocks. For galaxies this would be some stars, some dark matter, some gas and so on. What tools are included to build our galaxy. For our galaxy we mainly just need one screwdriver, gravity. The instructions for how to use our tools to put together our parts.  Question 1 is actually not as simple as it looks. When we go out and look at galaxies, we see that there seems to a building block that affects the galaxy a lot, but that we cannot see. This is what we call dark matter. While dark matter is weird, it is also quite simple. As far as we can tell, it only interacts with other things through gravity, but it is still fundamental to how galaxies end up being. This is because it collapses under its own gravity and makes gravitational wells where galaxies can form. These collapsed clumps are called halos.\nQuestion 3 is by far the most complicated when it comes to galaxies, because it is really hard to observe. Galaxies evolve over v e r y long timescales. Luckily, we have simulations we can investigate this with. There are a couple of key problems with the simulations though.\n They are computationally expensive. They are hard interpret/understand.  Making a model that emulates a simulation can solve problem 1 and give a lot of new insights into problem 2. So that is what we have done by building Mangrove. Mangrove is a Machine Learning based emulator that takes into account all three core aspects of galaxy formations, building blocks, tools and assembly manual, to give us better galaxies faster.\nTechnical stuff First of all, we don’t completely bypass the simulation step, since we still need to run a simulation, but only one with nothing but dark matter. Because dark matter is so simple, this can be done pretty quickly. Then, once we have that simulation, we can try to “paint” galaxies on top of the dark matter. This is by no means the first time this has been attempted, but earlier papers have only included features from the final time step of the simulation as their input to their model. This essentially means that these methods can learn answers to questions 1 and 2 (current building blocks/tools), but are agnostic about the assembly of the galaxies. Mangrove improves on this by using not just the final time step, but an encoding of the temporal evolution of the dark matter known as a merger tree.\nThe merger tree is made by simply stopping the simulation at different time steps and identifying the halos where we know that galaxies live. We then see which halos merge with other halos from timestep to timestep, and build a tree-like structure encoding this evolution (see Fig. 1).\n Fig.1 - Running a simulation and identifying halos at different time steps allows us to build the merger tree, which can then easily be encoded as a graph.   We can then encode the merger tree as a mathematical graph, which in this context simply means a collection of nodes and edges, where each node represents a halo, and the edges determine how they have interacted with each other over time. When we have the graphs we can use a Graph Neural Network (GNN), to learn how the galaxies pertaining to those merger trees should be.\nIn order to build an emulator, we also have to find something to emulate. In this post I discuss results from emulating the outputs from a Semi-Analytic Model1 but it works just as well for other kinds of simulations, like magneto-hydrodynamical simulations like IllustrisTNG!\nMangrove is a Graph Neural Network (GNN). GNNs work by acting on both nodes, and the neighbourhood of that node, meaning all the nodes that is connected to it by an edge. The way we learn from both nodes and neighbourhoods is through Message Passing. Message passing means that each node sends information about its current state along the edges of the graph, and is then updated by a learnable2 function f. This information passed along the edges is then used to update the state of the node through another learnable2 function g.\n   Fig.2 - Messages are passed along edges, and the nodes are updated.

The other version can be found under “Blog posts”.\nEfficiently mapping baryonic properties onto dark matter is a major challenge in astrophysics. Although semi-analytic models (SAMs)1 and hydrodynamical simulations have made impressive advances in reproducing galaxy observables across cosmologically significant volumes, these methods still require significant computation times, representing a barrier to many applications.\nSome advances have been made thanks to Machine Learning models, which learn mappings between the much less expensive dark matter only simulations and baryonic galaxy properties. However, these ML emulators still lack a lot of precision, and provide only few insights into the processes that they emulate! This is mainly because they try to map directly between dark matter halos and galaxies, ignoring formation and environmental effects.\nIn this project, we improved on both the precision and interpretability of previous work in the field, by including the formation history and showing that when it comes to nature versus nurture for galaxies, nurture matters a lot!\nWe do so by introducing Mangrove, a Graph Neural Network which works on merger trees, which encode the formation history of the dark matter halo.\nMangrove is twice as precise as other ML models, and allows us to put galaxies into dark matter simulations between 104 and 109 times faster than a SAM and IllustrisTNG codes, respectively.\n   Technical stuff First of all, we don’t completely bypass the simulation step, since we still need to run a simulation, but only one with nothing but dark matter.

We then see which halos merge with other halos from timestep to timestep, and build a tree-like structure encoding this evolution (see Fig. 1).\n Fig.1 - Running a simulation and identifying halos at different time steps allows us to build the merger tree, which can then easily be encoded as a graph.

After doing a couple of these message passing steps, we then sum over all halos in the merger tree and use yet another learnable function h, that decodes this sum and predicts the aspects of galaxies that we are interested in, such as the total mass of the stars in the galaxy, the mass of the black hole at the center and the amount of cold gas, as well as the uncertainties on these quantities.\nResults How much better does Mangrove do compared to methods you ask?\nWell, let’s compare how well assign stellar masses to halos work with different methods!\nThe first comparison is with the traditional method for assigning galaxy properties based on their dark matter halos, Abundance Matching.

Schauser during our third semester as physics undergraduates. Check out their GitHubs!\nIn all branches of physics, new discoveries are made by identifying some signal peak upon a background of noise. In High Energy Physics, this could be the peak of a new particle found amongst the almost uncountable amount of collisions happening every second the Large Hadron Collider is running. Only a few collisions actually produce interesting particles. This makes it crucial to be able to classify which detections are part of the actual signal, and which are not. In this project we employed a range of statistical methods and machine learning algorithms to get the best estimate of the masses of different $V^0$ - particles, in both simulated data and real data.\n   As can be seen in the top figure, among some of the methods tried were simply doing some linear cuts in the feature space, found by simple annealing, using Fisher’s discriminant analysis, a simple decision tree and some boosted decision tree algorithms, of which XGBoost ended up being the method of choice. We ended up getting an accuracy of 99.7% for classyfing signal and background.\nPerhaps the most exciting thing from this project was the ability for our models to learn what a true label looked like in real data without having those labels. Overall, the LHC dataset is fantastic as a learning platform for both classification and regression problem. If you would like to get involved, reach out to Troels C. Petersen. Anybody who wants to read the resulting report is welcome to do, by clicking the link at the top of the article, where we also explore a range of more or less wacky ideas.\n","date":1643068800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1643068800,"objectID":"438cb14f1e7c0b42aee0e8896827a7f2","permalink":"https://astrockragh.github.io/project/puk_troels/","publishdate":"2022-01-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/puk_troels/","section":"project","summary":"We go through several low - to medium level Machine Learning algorithms and optimize their performance for a classifying  $V^0$ - particles, both in simulation and real data","tags":["Machine Learning","Particle Physics"],"title":"Classifying  $V^0$ - particles from the ATLAS detector for detector calibration","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The duration of a gamma-ray burst (GRB) is a key indicator of its physical origin, with long bursts perhaps associated with the collapse of massive stars (also known as supernovae) and short bursts with mergers of neutron stars (kilonovae). However, trying to categorize these events from the burst itself is very troublesome, as there is substantial overlap in the properties of both short and long GRBs and neither duration nor any other parameter so far considered completely separates the two groups [insert figure]. Some very long bursts even show up without any observble supernova, even when we know exactly where it came from, which even led people to propose extra classes of bursts, like the Extended Short Gamma Ray Burst, to explain the lack of a supernova. In this project, which was done by myself and my two good friends Johann Bock Severin and Jonas Vinther as a semester project during our first year at the University of Copenhagen, we unambiguously classified every known GRB from the Swift Space observatory, using a dimensionality reduction algorithm, t-distributed stochastic neighborhood embedding, which had never been before and so was quite exciting. Although the classification takes place only using prompt emission light curves, every burst with an associated supernova is found in the longer group and bursts with kilonovae in the short, suggesting along with the duration distributions that these two groups are truly long and short GRBs, or some sort of proxy.\nSince t-SNE works by comparing vectors dimension by dimension, it was crucial that each dimension actually meant the same for each burst. Unfortunately, there is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding exactly when a burst begins or ends, so the lightcurves where rarely aligned such that the first second of a given burst meant the same as the first second of any other burst. The trick behind getting this to work was shifting the bursts from the time domain into the frequency domain using the ‘Fourier Transform’, which eliminates temporal translational differences in the lightcurves and makes it possible to actually compare the bursts dimension by dimension!\nRunning the machine learning algorithm on the Fourier transformed light curves let’s us get these two beautiful groups! TSNE GROUP FIGURE\nOne of the interesting things that came out of this project was to determine that those supernovae that we couldn’t find before go firmly in the group with all the other supernovae, so we’re pretty sure that they actually exploded, but the exact mechanism that led to an explosion with no visible supernova is still unknown. Professor Darach Watson at DAWN Copenhagen [link] currently has my favourite theory for why this is: Instead of the star exploding and then turning into a black hole, it would BOLD ‘implode’ and turn directly into a black hole!\nAnyone who wishes to do anything similar to this project is encourage to read the paper and check out the [Github](https://github.com/astrockragh/GRB_TSNE.

Schauser during our sixth semester as physics undergraduates. Check out their GitHubs!\nThis project was concerned with improving the reconstruction of neutrino events at The IceCube Neutrino Observatory, an experiment located at The South Pole, which aims to detect neutrinos and other particles in the ice sheet. Currently the observatory is focused on very very high energy neutrinos (TeV-PeV range) where the entire detector lights up and it is pretty easy to see where it came from, as can be seen in the video below.\n. However, IceCube actually gets many more events at lower energies (GeV range), so we wanted to help improving the reconstruction at these energies. Here, only a few dots light up, and it is hard to figure out anything about the particle. As you may also be able to see in the video, this is further complicated by the fact that the IceCube detector has a somewhat odd two-layer hexagonal-cylindrical shape, which makes traditional algorithms almost impossible to use. We therefore turned to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which are very powerful when learning on geometric data. It’s worth noting that grids are also special cases of graphs.\nWe found superior performance compared to the algorithm currently used by IceCube, which about a factor of a million increase in speed. The project was so successful that a group of people at the Niels Bohr Institute are currently doing a full-scale project, which you can find on the IceCube official Github.\nIf anyone has any questions, feel free to steal our code, read our report or reach out to me. The four different group members constructed four different model, varying from a few thousand parameters to multiple million, so this is also a great way of looking into model differences for the same task.\n","date":1642636800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642636800,"objectID":"b60a3ba1df2983dcc28229391386de62","permalink":"https://astrockragh.github.io/project/neutrino_ml/","publishdate":"2022-01-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/neutrino_ml/","section":"project","summary":"Using Graph Neural Networks, me and a group of friends showed that event reconstruction speed and precision for low-energy neutrino events can be greatly improved.","tags":["Machine Learning","Particle Physics","Cosmology"],"title":"Improving event reconstrution at IceCube","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The two CATALOGS: https://cosmos2020.calet.org/ The COSMOS survey is one the longest-running galaxy surveys.
